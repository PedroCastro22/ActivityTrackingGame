This is a tutorial on how to import the Unity project onto your PC

## Download Unity

Firstly you will need to have unity in your computer, the version I used for this project is the 2020.1.3f1 one, which can be found here:

https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.1.3

Make sure to opt-in for installing "Android Build Tools".

## Open the project

On UnityHub, add a project by clicking "Add" and set the project root directory for "src/RPG/RPG".

Open the project (This will take a while on the first time), load the "LobbyScene" which is located on "src/RPG/RPG/Assets/Scenes".

Go to "File -> Build Settings" and select Android as the platform instead of PC (You need Android Build Tools for this).

Then go the "Game" tab inside the editor and select the dimentions "1920x1080 Portrait".

## Run the Game

Once all of that is done, you can click on the play button and the game should run in your PC. 

If your device has a GPS, the character will spawn in your real life location. Else, the character will spawn in a GPS simulator and start simulating real life movement
